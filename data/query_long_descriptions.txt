#appts_per_doctor: Counts how many appointments each doctor has handled (including doctors with zero appointments). This reveals the workload distribution across providers, highlighting who is seeing the highest patient volumes and who might be underutilized. For example, it can flag overbooked physicians versus those with unused capacity.
#doctor_utilize_rate: Calculates each doctor’s utilization rate by comparing their monthly appointment count to an assumed capacity (e.g. 100 appointments per month). It produces a percentage of capacity used for each doctor. A higher utilization rate indicates a doctor is near or at full booking capacity, whereas a low rate points to underutilization. This metric helps quickly spot if any doctor is overburdened or if clinic capacity is being underused.
#doctors_by_range_of_procs: Identifies doctors by the diversity of procedures they have performed, based on the number of distinct procedure names each has done. This essentially highlights which doctors have a broad scope of practice (handling many types of procedures) versus those who focus on a narrower set. Doctors performing a wide range of procedures may be more generalist or versatile, while those with fewer distinct procedures might be highly specialized. This insight can inform staffing and training by revealing the distribution of skills and specializations among providers.
#num_doctors_per_spec: Counts how many doctors practice in each specialty. This gives a supply-side view of provider availability by department or specialty. In combination with patient and appointment data, it helps assess whether certain departments are potentially understaffed or overstaffed relative to their workload.
#ttl_appts_per_spec: Tallies the total number of appointments handled by each specialty. This acts as a demand indicator for each department, showing which specialties see the most patient volume. High appointment counts in a specialty reflect high patient demand for that department’s services. When compared against num_doctors_per_spec, it provides insight into whether the physician supply in a specialty is proportionate to the demand.
#doctor_performance_dash: An aggregated performance dashboard per doctor, summarizing each doctor’s total appointments, total procedures performed, and total billing amount. By consolidating these key metrics, this query provides a one-stop view of each doctor’s productivity and financial contribution. It allows easy comparison across doctors – for instance, seeing that Dr. A handled 120 appointments, 80 procedures, and generated $200k in billing last quarter, versus Dr. B with 90 appointments, 50 procedures, and $150k billing. Such a dashboard helps identify outliers, like a doctor with very high appointment counts but lower revenue (perhaps indicating shorter, low-complexity visits) versus a doctor with fewer appointments but high revenue (indicating more complex or procedure-heavy cases). This information is valuable for management to balance workloads and recognize where efficiencies or additional support might be needed.

#ttl_appts_per_patient: Lists each patient alongside the total number of appointments they have had, sorted from most to least. This highlights the most frequent visitors (high-utilization patients). Those patients with an unusually large number of appointments may be managing chronic conditions or require frequent follow-ups, indicating they drive a disproportionate share of demand. Identifying these patients helps in understanding and managing heavy users of healthcare resources.
#avg_num_proc_per_appt_per_patient: Calculates the average number of procedures per appointment for each patient. For each patient, it shows on average how many procedures are done during their visits. Patients with a high average (significantly more than 1 procedure per visit) might be those with complex needs – for example, someone with a chronic illness requiring multiple procedures or tests at each visit. This metric gives a sense of the intensity of care each patient typically requires and can flag patients who consistently need more resources per visit.
#patients_with_multiple_doctors: Identifies patients who have seen more than one doctor by counting distinct doctors per patient. A high count of patients seeing multiple doctors could indicate a lot of referrals or specialist consultations, meaning many patients require multidisciplinary care. If many patients see multiple providers, it may suggest cases are complex enough that one doctor cannot meet all their needs, or that care is being coordinated across specialties. This insight can highlight the extent of care coordination in the facility and whether patients are bouncing between providers.
#new_vs_returning: Classifies patients based on their appointment counts into “New” (first-time patients with only one appointment) versus “Returning” (repeat patients with multiple appointments). This helps gauge patient turnover and growth in demand. A high influx of New patients indicates growth – new patient demand is increasing, which might require expanding provider capacity or clinic hours to accommodate. Conversely, a large proportion of Returning patients indicates a stable or loyal patient base with ongoing needs, which requires sustained resources (and possibly strategies to manage chronic or follow-up care efficiently). Tracking the balance of new vs returning patients over time is useful for forecasting demand and resource planning.
#patient_demand: Identifies the patients with the highest overall demand on services, considering both appointment volume and procedure count. In essence, this query pinpoints the top patients in terms of resource utilization – those who come in frequently and/or receive many procedures. This combined view can reveal which patients are the heaviest users of healthcare resources. Such information is useful for case management; for example, it may prompt the creation of special care plans or dedicated programs for high-need patients to ensure their needs are met more efficiently and to distribute workload appropriately among providers.

#freq_of_proc: Counts how many times each type of procedure (by procedure name) has been performed across all appointments. This effectively ranks procedures by frequency (popularity), showing which procedures are most common overall. It is a direct indicator of patient demand for specific services – for instance, whether routine procedures like blood tests are far more frequent than specialized surgeries. Identifying the most commonly performed procedures helps ensure that the hospital has adequate resources (staff, equipment) for those high-demand procedures.
#num_procs_per_appt: Calculates the number of procedures performed in each individual appointment (e.g. 0, 1, 2, … procedures per visit). This reveals the distribution of procedural workload per visit. It can show how often appointments involve multiple procedures versus a single procedure or none. For example, many appointments may have 0 procedures (pure consultations), while some have 2-3 procedures (perhaps surgical visits or multi-test sessions). This helps in understanding the typical complexity of visits – a high occurrence of multiple-procedure appointments might indicate more intensive use of resources per visit, affecting scheduling and resource allocation (longer appointment slots, more staff per visit, etc.).
#doctor_proc_freq: Tallies how many times each doctor performed each type of procedure, usually sorted by the most common procedure-doctor combinations. This query crosses provider activity with procedure frequency, exposing whether the demand for certain procedures is concentrated among specific doctors. For example, it might show that Dr. X performed Procedure A 50 times (making Dr. X a high-volume provider for that procedure), whereas other doctors performed it far less. Such insights highlight specialization or uneven workload distribution – if only a few doctors handle a majority of a particular procedure, it may indicate a bottleneck or a highly specialized skill concentrated in certain staff. This information can be useful for cross-training decisions or understanding referral patterns (e.g. all orthopedic surgeries done by one surgeon).
#avg_num_procs_per_appt_by_doctor: Calculates the average number of procedures per appointment for each doctor. This metric indicates how procedure-intensive each doctor’s visits are on average. For instance, surgeons or specialists might perform multiple procedures in a single appointment (leading to a higher average), whereas general practitioners might rarely perform procedures (yielding an average closer to 0 or 1). By highlighting these differences, the query provides insight into practice patterns – some doctors handle more complex visits with multiple interventions, while others have simpler visits. It helps in understanding and comparing doctor workloads beyond just appointment counts, factoring in the complexity of those appointments.
#proc_performance_sum: Provides a summary of each procedure type, including the total number of times it was performed and the total billing amount generated from it. This combines volume and financial performance for procedures, essentially showing the “productivity” or yield of each procedure type. It identifies which procedures contribute the most to overall revenue and how frequently those high-value procedures occur. For example, a procedure that is done moderately often but has a very high billing rate will show up as a major revenue contributor. This insight is critical for strategic planning – knowing which procedures are both common and high-revenue can guide investment in those service lines, while procedures that are common but low-revenue (or rare but high-cost) might be areas to evaluate for efficiency or cost management.

#ttl_billing_by_doctor: Sums up all billing amounts attributable to each doctor (via the patients and appointments they oversaw). This effectively ranks doctors by the total revenue generated through their care. Doctors with higher totals are contributing the most financially, which typically reflects a combination of seeing more patients and/or performing higher-value services. This metric is a proxy for productivity and can correlate with workload and specialization (e.g. a surgeon performing many big-ticket procedures may top the list). It provides a clear view of which providers drive the largest share of billing, useful for resource allocation and recognizing high-impact clinical areas.
#avg_billed_amt_per_appt_by_doctor: Calculates the average billed amount per appointment for each doctor by dividing each doctor’s total billing by their number of appointments. This highlights differences in revenue per visit among doctors. A higher average billing per appointment suggests that a doctor’s visits tend to involve more expensive procedures or services (for instance, a specialist performing surgeries or advanced diagnostics), whereas a lower average might indicate more routine check-ups or consultations. This metric helps in understanding the nature of each doctor’s practice – for example, two doctors might have the same number of appointments, but one generates much higher revenue due to the type of services provided.
#proc_billing_summary_per_doctor: For each doctor, this query lists each procedure type they performed along with the count of that procedure and the average billed amount for it. In other words, it breaks down a doctor’s procedure portfolio and the typical revenue per procedure. This is useful to see which procedures contribute most to each doctor’s billing. It may reveal, for example, that Doctor A’s revenue comes largely from a certain surgery type (done many times at a high average cost), whereas Doctor B’s revenue is spread across many smaller procedures. It also shows if some doctors focus on high-billing procedures versus others who perform a higher volume of lower-billing procedures. Such insights can guide training, specialization, and even negotiations or performance evaluations, by understanding each doctor’s financial contribution in detail.
#ttl_billing_per_patient: Returns each patient’s total billing amount accumulated, sorted from highest to lowest. This identifies the patients who incur the highest costs (or generate the most revenue, depending on perspective). Patients with very high total billing could be those with prolonged or intensive treatments (e.g. multiple surgeries, long hospital stays, chronic disease management). Recognizing these patients can be important for case management and financial planning – for instance, high-billing patients might benefit from targeted care programs to manage their conditions more cost-effectively, and the hospital might need to ensure their needs are met without incurring avoidable costs. It also helps in understanding revenue concentration (e.g. does a small percentage of patients account for a large chunk of revenue?).
#avg_billing_by_hour: Calculates the average billing amount for appointments during each hour of the day (aggregating across all days). This reveals how revenue generation varies by time of day. For example, if certain hours (say 10-11 AM) have a much higher average billing, it might be because that hour is commonly used for surgeries or multiple procedures, whereas early afternoon might show lower averages if mostly follow-up visits occur then. Understanding which hours tend to yield higher billing can help in scheduling optimization – ensuring high-value procedures are given adequate slots or understanding if high-revenue activities are concentrated in specific parts of the day. It could also hint at when more expensive resources (like specialized staff or equipment) are in use.
#monthly_proc_and_billing_summary: Provides a month-by-month summary of the total number of procedures performed and the total billing amount. This helps in spotting trends or seasonal patterns in service demand and revenue. For instance, it can show if certain months have spikes in procedures (which could indicate seasonal illnesses, elective surgery cycles, etc.) or if revenue dips in certain periods (perhaps due to fewer business days or patient seasonality). By tracking both procedure volume and billing together, it’s possible to see if increases in procedures correspond to proportional increases in revenue or if some months had more lower-cost procedures. This information supports planning for seasonal staffing, budgeting, and setting performance targets based on historical trends.
#peak_hour_day: Tallies the total number of appointments, grouped by hour of the day and day of the week, in order to identify peak clinic times. This effectively answers: “When are we the busiest?” It might show, for example, that mid-morning hours on Mondays and Tuesdays are extremely busy, whereas late afternoons or Fridays are quieter. By pinpointing the peak days and hours for patient appointments, management can optimize resource allocation – such as ensuring more doctors, nurses, or support staff are scheduled during those high-demand times, and possibly extending hours or adding slots in periods of overflow. It also aids in understanding patient behavior and operational bottlenecks (e.g. if Monday 9-10 AM is always full, perhaps patient demand is carrying over from the weekend or everyone prefers the start of the week for visits).
