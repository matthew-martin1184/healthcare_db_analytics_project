# Healthcare DB Analytics with SQL and Python

Welcome! This project explores a simulated healthcare system's database using Python, SQL, and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse. The goal is to demonstrate data integration, relational schema modeling, and meaningful analytics using real-world healthcare concepts.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Relational schema design using `PATIENT`, `DOCTOR`, `APPOINTMENT`, `BILLING`, and `MEDICAL_PROCEDURE` tables
- SQL queries and views for insights like appointment frequency, doctor workload, and patient billing summaries
- Data transformation and visualization with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
- End-to-end pipeline from raw `.csv` to live Oracle DB

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, oracledb, matplotlib)
- Oracle Autonomous Database (Free Tier)
- GitHub Pages
- Jupyter Notebooks
